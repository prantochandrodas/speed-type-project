            <h2>1.Difference between global scope and block scope.</h3>
            <p>Ans:-Global scope:- In a programming environment, the global scope is the scope that contains, and is visible in, all other scopes. <br><br>
                Block Level Scope:- This scope restricts the variable that is declared inside a specific block, from access by the outside of the block. The let & const keyword facilitates the variables to be block scoped. In order to access the variables of that specific block, we need to create an object for it.  </p>
